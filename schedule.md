Oggcamp may be an unconference, but that doesn't mean we haven't got plenty planned across the weekend!

You can rate and comment on talks you've seen at Oggcamp by visiting our [[Joind.in](https://joind.in/event/oggcamp-17/schedule/grid)] page.

## Friday

We are meeting on Friday from 7pm in *"The Ballroom"* in Orange Street [[Map](http://w3w.co/turns.agents.props)] for pre-conference drinks. The Ballroom does not serve food, but there are plenty of options in the area - see the [Venue](/venue) page for more details!
