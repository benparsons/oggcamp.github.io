# Social Events

## Friday, 17th August

We are meeting on Friday from 7pm in [*"The Bankers Draft"*](https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/south-yorkshire/the-bankers-draft-sheffield) on Market Place [[Map](https://w3w.co/lime.cave.liner)] for pre-conference drinks. We have not provisioned for any food to be served, however, this is a Weatherspoons Pub, so they may be serving food.

## Saturday, 18th August

The Saturday night social will be in *"Hideout"*, at Sheffield Hallam's Student Union bar [[Map](https://w3w.co/salt.giving.force)], again from 7pm. No provision for food has been made, and you should find somewhere to eat beforehand.

## Sunday, 19th August

On Sunday, once we have finished the event, anyone who is still around is welcome to join us at [*"Sentinel Brewhouse"*](http://www.sentinelbrewing.co) on the junction of Mary Street and Shoreham Street [[Map](https://w3w.co/soup.allows.tables)]. We've made no provision for food here either, so it's probably worth getting something to eat first.
