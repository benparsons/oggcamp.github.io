If you are travelling by car then it is recommended to use [JustPark](https://www.justpark.com/) to find a cheap parking spot within a reasonable walking distance of the venue. It should be possible to park for both days for less than £10 if you book quickly!

Canterbury also has Park and Ride facilities [[Link](https://www.canterbury.gov.uk/parking-travel-roads/park-and-ride/)]. For £3 per day, you can park outside the city centre [[here](http://w3w.co/shells.piles.chefs) or [[here](http://w3w.co/froth.spoon.final)] and take a bus to the bus station, which is less than 5 minutes away from the accommodation and less than 10 minutes away from the venue.

Canterbury is very well connected to London. The quickest way is via the High Speed Train from St Pancras International (to Canterbury West, ca 55 min + 20 minutes walking), but you can also reach it via a slightly slower train from Victoria (to Canterbury East, ca 1:30h + 10 minutes walking) or, if you are on a budget, via the 007 or 022 National Express Coach from Victoria Coach Station.
