title: OggCamp 2016, OggCamp 2017 and other events 
---
Further to our recent notice, we confirm that OggCamp will not occur in 2016 but we have a combined team of new and old organisers who are working towards OggCamp 2017.

If you are looking for a similar event for 2016 you might enjoy one of the following events (in no particular order):

* FOSS Talk Live
* Wuthering Bytes
* Barcamp Manchester

We look forward to seeing you, either at one of these events, or at OggCamp â€™17
